In this cookbook, you will learn how to create a simple script command. You will see that
you can create it dynamically without restarting CRaSH.

{{note}}
A better solution to create a command is to use CRaSH class.It provides tools
to simply command creation.

= Run CRaSH =

{{screen}}
cd $CRASH_HOME/bin
./crash.sh

= Add new command =

To add a command to CRaSH. You have to add a groovy file in the cmd directory :

{{screen}}
cd $CRASH_HOME/cmd
vi test.groovy
{{/screen}}

Put the following in test.groovy :

{{screen}}
for (int i = 0;i < 10;i++) {
  System.out.println("CRaSH is cool !");
}
{{/screen}}

{{note}}
In this example, we create a command by using Java syntax.
It's because Groovy understand Java Syntax. So you could begin to develop
your command in Java and when you want try cool Groovy stuff.
