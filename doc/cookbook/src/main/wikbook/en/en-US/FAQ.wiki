== What is CRaSH ? ==

CRaSH is a shell that extends JVM. With CRaSH, you will connect with a shell directly on a JVM.
Moreover, you could add your command (Java/Groovy) and that's why CRaSH is really interesting.

== What can I do with CRaSH ? ==

* Monitoring JVM and make your own dashboard command.
* Make command for your application (add data in a cache, add user, monitor jobs ).
* Make your JMX command.

== What is the differences between CRaSH and JMX ? Is the same ? ==

JMX provides only bean and methods.That's all.
CRaSH permit to access to JMX and to make command with it.
CRaSH also permit to make script with thread, jdbc, entity ...
