There are several ways to run CRaSH.

CRaSH provides has various ways to be started, it can also be easily embedded.

= Standalone =

== Standalone mode ==

The standalone mode allows you to run CRaSH from the command line directly. It provides the same functionality as the
war deployment but does not require a web container as it runs its own virtual machine. The directory __crash__ directory
in the application contains the standalone distribution.

The bin directory ///crash/bin// can be added to the system path, it contains the //crash.sh// script that will start
the standalone mode, for instance you can set it up this way:

{{screen}}
> export PATH=/.../crash/bin:$PATH
> crash.sh
   ______
 .~      ~. |`````````,       .'.                   ..'''' |         |
|           |'''|'''''      .''```.              .''       |_________|
|           |    `.       .'       `.         ..'          |         |
 `.______.' |      `.   .'           `. ....''             |         | 1.0.0-cr2-SNAPSHOT

Let's review quickly what you can find in standalone crash:

* The //bin// directory contains the //crash.sh// script and the standalone crash jar file
* The //conf// directory contains the configuration proerties //crash.properties// and JVM logging configuration //logging.properties//
* The //cmd// directory contains the commands that will be available in crash by default it contains a few example commands
* The //lib// directory contains the various libraries used by crash, you should place additional jar files there

== Attach mode ==

The attach mode allows you to attach CRaSH to a JVM located on the same host with the attach API provided by the Hotspot
JVM. It works thanks to the standalone mode, the main difference is when you run the command line you can specify a
process id of a JVM and CRaSH will hook into the targetted JVM, let's see quickly an example of how to use it

In this example we will attach crash to the Test JVM. We obtained the Test JVM PID thanks to the //jps// command that belongs
to the Java Platform. During this mode the commands are executed in the target JVM.

= Embedded mode =

== Embedding as a web archive ==

CRaSH can use a standard web archive to be deployed in a web container. The war file is used for its packaging capabilities
and triggering the CRaSH life cycle start/stop. In this mode CRaSH has two packaging available:

* A __core__ war file found under //deploy/core/crash.war// provides the base CRaSH functionnalities.
* A __gatein__ war file found under //deploy/gatein/crash.war// provides additional Java Content Repository (JCR)
 features but deploys only in a GateIn server (Tomcat or JBoss). It extends the core packaging and adds
** JCR browsing and interactions
** SCP support for JCR import and export

You have to copy the //crash.war// in the appropriate server, regardless of the packaging used.

If you want you can embed CRaSH in your own //web.xml// configuration:

{{example title="Embedding CRaSH in a web application"}}
{{xml}}
<web-app>
  <listener>
    <listener-class>org.crsh.plugin.WebPluginLifeCycle</listener-class>
  </listener>
</web-app>
{{/xml}}
{{/example}}

== Embedding with Spring ==

CRaSH can be easily embedded and configured in a Spring configuration, here is an example of embedding crash:

{{example title="Embedding CRaSH in SPring with the Telnet plugin"}}
{{xml}}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
       http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-3.0.xsd">

	<bean class="org.crsh.spring.SpringBootstrap">
    <property name="config">
      <props>
        <prop key="crash.telnet.port">4000</prop>
      </props>
    </property>
	</bean>

  <bean class="org.crsh.telnet.TelnetPlugin">
  </bean>

</beans>
{{/xml}}
{{/example}}

In this mode, the plugins are not discovered using the classpath, instead each plugin must be declared as a Spring bean.

The configuration properties can be also set as properties with the //config// property of the ##SpringBootstrap## bean.
