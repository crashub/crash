= SCP usage =

Secure copy can be used to import or export content. The username/password prompted by the SSH server will be used
for authentication against the repository when the import or the export is performed.

== Export a JCR node ==

The following command will export the node ///gadgets// in the repository //portal-system//
of the portal container //portal//:

{{screen}}
scp -P 2000 root@localhost:portal:portal-system:/production/app:gadgets gadgets.xml
{{/screen}}

The node will be exported as //app_gadgets.xml//.

Note that the portal container name is used for GateIn. If you do omit it, then the root container will be used.

== Import a JCR node ==

The following command will reimport the node:

{{screen}}
scp -P 2000 gadgets.xml root@localhost:portal:portal-system:/production/
{{/screen}}

The exported file format use the JCR system view. You can get more information about that in the JCR specification.

{{caution}}The SCP feature is experimental{{/caution}}
