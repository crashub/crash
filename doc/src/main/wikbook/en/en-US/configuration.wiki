= Configuration properties =

CRaSH is configured by a set of properties, these properties are defined in a configuration file. In the war file packaging,
the configuration file can be found under ///WEB-INF/crash/crash.properties// file of the archive. Configuration can be overriden
by Java Virtual Machine system properties by using the same property name.

{{note}}
CRaSH properties are always prefixed by the //crash.// value
{{/note}}

= Change the SSH server key =

The key can be changed by replacing the file //WEB-INF/sshd/hostkey.pem//. Alternatively you can configure the server
to use an external file by using the //crash.ssh.keypath// parameter in the //crash.properties//. Uncomment the corresponding
property and change the path to the key file.

{{code}}
#crash.ssh.keypath=/path/to/the/key/file
{{/code}}

= Change the ports of the telnet or SSH server =

The ports of the server are parameterized by the //crash.ssh.port// and //crash.telnet.port// parameters in the //crash.properties// file

{{code}}
# SSH configuration
crash.ssh.port=2000
{{/code}}

{{code}}
# Telnet configuration
crash.telnet.port=5000
{{/code}}

= Remove the telnet or SSH access =

* to remove the telnet access, remove the jar file in the //WEB-INF/lib/crsh.shell.telnet-$[crash.version].jar// .
* to remove the SSH access, remove the jar file in the //WEB-INF/lib/crsh.shell.ssh-$[crash.version].jar// .

= Configure the shell default message =

The ///WEB-INF/crash/commands/base/login.groovy// file contains two closures that are evaluated each time a message is required

* The ##prompt## closure returns the prompt message
* The ##welcome## closure returns the welcome message

Those closure can be customized to return different messages.

= Configuration the authentication =

Authentication is used by the SSH server when a user authenticates. Authentication interface is pluggable and has default
implementations. The [[#pluggable_auth]] explains how to write a custom authentication plugin, in this section we cover the
configuation of the authentication.

The configuration of the authentication plugin is done via property, this is necessary because several plugins can be detected
by CRaSH, and the plugin is selected via the property //crash.auth// that must match the authentication plugin name:

{{code}}
crash.auth=simple
{{/code}}

CRaSH comes out of the box with two authentication plugins.

== Simple authentication ==

Simple authentication provides a simple username/password authentication configured with the //crash.auth.simple.username// and
//crash.auth.simple.password// properties:

{{code}}
# Authentication configuration
crash.auth=simple
crash.auth.simple.username=admin
crash.auth.simple.password=admin
{{/code}}

== Jaas authentation ==

Jaas authentication uses jaas to perform authentication configured with the //crash.auth.jaas.domain// property to define the
jaas domain to use when performing authentication:

{{code}}
# Authentication configuration
crash.auth=jaas
crash.auth.jaas.domain=gatein-domain
{{/code}}
